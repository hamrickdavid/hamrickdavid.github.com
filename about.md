<h1>About David Hamrick</h1>

I'm [David Hamrick](http://www.twitter.com/davidhamrick). I co-own [Hamrick Software](http://www.hamrick.com), a small software company that develops VueScan, an application for OS X, Windows, Linux, and iOS that makes using your document and photo scanners fast and easy.

I worked as a contract iOS developer from 2009-2012, primarily for [Mercury Intermedia](http://www.mercury.io) in Nashville, Tennessee. There I was part of a team that developed 3 applications that were ranked #1 overall in the iOS app store and 14 apps that were ranked #1 in their category. 

I am an alumnus of Vanderbilt University, having earned a degree in Computer Engineering and Engineering Management. I currently live in Nashville, TN after having lived in the UK for 10 years.
