    <div class="row">
      <div class="span12 columns">                  
        <p>We think most SilverFast users will prefer VueScan because:</p> 
        <ul> 
          <li>VueScan is easier to use
          <li>VueScan produces better scans
          <li>Infrared cleaning in VueScan is better, especially with Kodachrome
          <li>You can use one copy of VueScan with up to 4 different computers
          <li>You can use one copy of VueScan with all your scanners
          <li>You get unlimited free upgrades (forever) with the Professional Edition
          <li>VueScan supports 1750 scanners, SilverFast 8 supports 20 scanners
          <li>VueScan is a 5 MByte download, SilverFast 8 is a 170 MByte download
        </ul> 
        <p>Also, Hamrick Software has has always been open and honest with our customers. Some examples:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li><p>On January 16, 2006 Hamrick Software announced that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/01/prweb332206.htm">VueScan supports the Intel Macs</a>. Of course, VueScan really was a Universal Binary and worked well on Intel Macs.</p></li>
          <li><p>On October 30, 2007 LaserSoft announced that <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/outstanding-results-with-SilverFast-now-running-universal-58973267.html">Outstanding Results With SilverFast! Now Running Universal</a>. The only problem is that this wasn't true - SilverFast 6 never was updated to be a Universal Binary, only one small program, the "Launcher", was a Universal Binary.  This is the reason SilverFast 6 doesn't work on Mac OS X Lion today - it was never updated from PowerPC to Intel.</p></li>
          <li><p>On March 10, 2011 Hamrick Software announced that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/03/prweb5142834.htm">VueScan adds support for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</a>. Of course, every version of VueScan since this announcement works well on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.</p></li>
          <li>On March 12, 2011 (two days later) LaserSoft announced that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/03/prweb5157394.htm">SilverFast Supports Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</a> The only problem is that this was misleading - SilverFast 6 doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and most customers need to pay up to $200 to upgrade to SilverFast 8.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We believe in being open and honest with our customers, and hope we've earned the trust of our customers.  We also believe in always having a technically superior product.</p>

      <h2>Why is LaserSoft Struggling?</h2> 
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span12 columns">     
        One of my favorite German sayings is "Der Fisch stinkt vom Kopf"
        (The fish stinks from the head, Рыба гниёт с головы).  
        The fate of LaserSoft is largely due to the product strategy of their president,
        Karl-Heinz Zahorsky.<p> 

        He's a nice guy - I've met him, I like him, I used to talk to him on the phone
        every month or two and he has excellent engineers working for him.  However,
        the company strategy didn't adapt with the times.<p> 

        The strategy for SilverFast has been to make expensive software for
        expensive scanners and make the majority of revenues from bundling this
        software with scanners.<p> 

        Unfortunately, scanner technology reached it's peak 5 years ago.  There's
        seldom any need for reflective scans higher than 600 dpi, and the best
        film scanners ever made were released by Nikon 8 years ago (CoolScan 5000
        and CoolScan V).<p> 

        95% of all scanners sold today are multi-function printer/scanner/copiers,
        most notably from Canon, Epson and HP.  Nikon stopped making film scanners
        years ago, and now you can only buy used Nikon scanners on ebay.  No
        other high-quality film scanners are sold any more because the market
        for film scanners is rapidly shrinking.<p> 

        Anyone who primarly does reflective scans can buy a good printer/scanner/copier
        for $100, and anyone still scanning film can use the Epson V700 to do this.
        The problem LaserSoft has is that they don't support any printer/scanner/copiers
        and nobody needs SilverFast with Epson scanners (Epson Scan is actually better).<p> 

        This leads to a dilemma - the market for the scanners SilverFast supports
        is shrinking rapidly, and even the least expensive printer/scanner/copiers
        are more than good enough for 99% of reflective scanning.  What can LaserSoft
        do, other than try to reduce costs by laying off engineers and delay new
        product development?  It's been 5 years since Intel Macs were introduced,
        and LaserSoft still hasn't released a universal binary version of SilverFast.<p> 

        The majority of LaserSoft revenues used to come from bundled software
        sales, but Nikon doesn't make scanners any more, Microtek went out of
        business, Minolta went out of business, Epson Scan is better than SilverFast,
        Canon sells many more printer/scanner/copiers than high-end flatbed scanners,
        HP's G4050 isn't very good, Plustek and Reflecta scanners aren't very good,
        and the expensive scanners previously sold by Heidelberg are obsolete.<p> 

        In addition, the SilverFast product pricing isn't competitive.  There
        are two approaches - low cost and high volume or high cost and low volume.
        LaserSoft has chosen the latter, but high cost doesn't work when good
        reflective scanners cost $100 and film scanning can be done better with
        VueScan or Epson Scan.<p> 

        LaserSoft has also annoyed their users for years, never releasing
        a Universal Binary version on the Mac, poor support for Windows x64,
        high prices, needing to buy another copy of SilverFast for each
        scanner, and generally not listening to their users.<p> 

        What can LaserSoft do to survive?  They don't ask for my advice,
        and free advice is worth what you pay for it. :)<p> 

        However, Hamrick Software's strategy is to focus on making high-quality
        software that's easy to use and that adds value over the free software
        that comes with most scanners today.  We're also committed to keeping
        our prices low and expanding into new markets (printer/scanner/copiers and
        iPhone and iPad).<p> 

        We also think our development strategy is superior to LaserSoft's, since
        we do frequent, incremental product improvements - and have 4000 people
        test these improved versions every day.  This leads to higher product
        quality than SilverFast, which only has significant new releases
        every 5 years or so.<p> 

        In the end, the success or failure of a company is determined by
        product strategy and product quality.  We're happy with the product
        strategy for VueScan and the quality of VueScan, and we hope more
        and more SilverFast users will agree.<p>
