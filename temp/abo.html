	      <p>Hamrick Software was founded in Phoenix, Arizona in 1991 by Ed Hamrick. Our first product was VuePrint, an easy to use JPEG viewer for Windows that for many years was the recommended image viewer for AOL, with more than 100,000 users. In 1998, the company first released VueScan, a program for scanning with flatbed and film scanners with more than 250,000 users all over the world.</p>
	      <p>VueScan supports over 1750 flatbed and film scanners and 321 digital camera raw file types, and is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. It automatically adjusts images to optimum color balance, which reduces the need to manually do this in Photoshop. VueScan includes built-in color calibration of scanners, producing colors that look true to life. Supporting more than 100 brands of negative film, VueScan offers options for scanning faded slides and prints, batch scanning, IT8 color calibration and other advanced scanning features.</p>

				<p>Hamrick Software is a father and son team: Ed Hamrick and his youngest son David Hamrick.</p>
				<p>Ed Hamrick has always been interested in photography, and when he purchased his first film scanner (an HP PhotoSmart) in 1997 he decided to see if he could produce better quality scans than the software that came with the scanner. The result of this was a program called VueSmart. After upgrading to the Nikon LS-30, Ed modified VueSmart to support multiple scanners and renamed it VueScan. In the following years, Ed added support for many different scanners, and is constantly adding support for new scanners, implementing suggestions from users, and adding new features. As a result, new versions of VueScan are released frequently.</p>
	      <p>Ed Hamrick graduated with honors from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) with a degree in Engineering and Applied Science. He worked for three years at NASA/JPL as a programmer, and worked at Boeing as a programmer and manager for ten years. Subsequently, Ed worked for five years at Convex Computer Corporation as a Systems Engineer and Systems Engineering Manager.</p>
	      <p>Ed is married and has three children. He speaks fluent English, Russian and German.</p>
	      <p>David Hamrick is the author of VueScan Mobile. David graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2011 with a degree in Computer Engineering. David speaks fluent English and German.</p>

	Les. Hughes, Editor and Publisher Jaguar Magazine:<p> 

	"Vuescan is like magic and transformed the program which came with my expensive CanoScan FS4000 slide scanner 
	all those years ago.  I am a professional small business magazine and book publisher 
	(<a href="http://www.jaguarmagazine.com" rel="nofollow">www.jaguarmagazine.com</a>) 
	and your Vuescan allows me to scan anything to the same standard as the 'big boys', saving me a small fortune 
	and giving me the flexibility I need to publish on time.  Your service back-up is also impeccable.<p> 

	<hr> 

	With one of Norway's largest aviation photo archives on slide, Kjell

	digitize around 15,000 images and is still adding new slides. Some can
	be seen at <a href="http://www.scanavphoto.no" rel="nofollow">www.scanavphoto.no</a>.
	Kjell says: "Without batch-scanning in VueScan this task would have been impossible.
	I get the required quality for digital preview and can return to the slide for
	a higher quality scan as required."<p>

	Stan Brown of Miami University Library:<p> 

	Students at Miami University use VueScan in their library for all their
	needs. In charge of the library, Stan Brown says that VueScan is soon to
	be used on their digitising projects. "VueScan does the best job for
	us - we are very pleased with its functionality and efficiency"<p>

	<a href="http://www.imagerylab.com" rel="nofollow">Imagerylab.com</a>:<p> 

	Just a quick note to let you know how happy we at
	Imagerylab.com are with your VueScan software.  One
	very helpful feature of VueScan is it's ability to
	'remember' previous settings for different types of
	film media.  We don't have to constantly re-setup
	VueScan whenever we switch between B/W and
	color-reversal film types.  VueScan remembers previous
	setting based on film type and this saves us in setup
	time.<p> 

	Also, our business is attracting high quality
	photographers who recognize the benefits of our
	scanning using VueScan software.<p> 

	<hr> 

	<a href="http://www.sacalobra.com/" rel="nofollow">Sacalobra Studios</a>:<p> 

	Thank you very much for integrating the support for the Nikon 
	Coolscan 9000 as well as the Coolscan 5000 - the frame alignment 
	works like a charm!<p> 

	Finally all the hassle with the Nikon support is over: I've purchased 
	a serial number and installed the latest version.<p> 

	Incredible details, no jaggies even in enlargements @ 300%, very 
	smooth color gradients, fantastic shadow details and much, much more. 
	The list is long!. Even without multi sample scanning the images 
	render much more detailed an sharper compared to the Nikon Scan 
	software.<p> 

	Your latest VueScan brings back the 'art of scanning' high quality 
	slides from 35mm to 6x9 cm. It's amazing how fast VueScan works with 
	the Nikon scanners now - it's like steroids on the machines! <p> 

	Last but not least: the color rendition is absolutely superb - now we 
	don't have any problems scanning Fuji Velvia 50 (the old one!). <p> 

	10 out of 10 stars for you! **********<p> 

	With kind regards / Con saludos cordiales / Mit freundlichen Grüssen<p>

	This is just a note to let you know how pleased I am with my recent purchase
	of VueScan.  I run a small, home-based business designing DVDs for people,
	transferring photos, negatives, movie film, etc., and of course, I do a lot
	of slide scanning.  My Nikon SuperCoolscan 5000s (both with SF-210 bulk
	adaptors) are great, but the Nikon Scan software always left a lot to be
	desired; it was slow, crashed often, and with the installation of Tiger
	(10.4.2) it worked even more sporadically, scanning a slide or two, and then
	freezing.<p> 

	As a matter of fact, it seems to me now that a lot of the batch scanning
	stoppages I experienced were NOT due to the jamming of the SF-210 bulk
	feeder, but were Nikon Scan software related instead.<p> 

	I am currently in the middle of a 3500-slide job, and after arriving at the
	perfect combination of settings for Kodachrome slides, I have experienced no
	problems or jams yet.  I like the ability to save different setups, as well.<p> 

	I plan to try it soon with my Epson 4870 as well.<p> 

	Thanks for a great product!<p>

	Larry Auton - long-time VueScan user:<p> 

	I've been a user of Vuescan on Linux since July 2001.  Today, I
	scanned a batch of negatives and was reminded what an outstanding
	product you provide.  Thanks for years of great service.<p> 

	<hr> 

	Larry Hogrewe, Pond Films:<p> 

	It works perfectly, I will always be in your debt.
	I was about to buy Lasersoft for $500.00.
	Again thank you for a wonderful product.<p> 

	<hr> 

	Bill Van Dyck - long-time VueScan user:<p> 

	Thank you for VueScan.  I have owned it and raved about my results
	using it for years now.  Honestly, I don't remember how long I have
	been a VueScan user, but I still get excited every time I download
	one of your free updates.  I use VueScan to get slides and negatives
	(35mm & 120) into my computer and there is not a single product on
	the market that works as well.  Your continual effort to make
	VueScan the best product available has been impressive.<p> 

	My original version of VueScan was an outstanding product that
	turned an old scanner from photographically useless to a very good
	image maker.  Today's VueScan is a much better product than that
	original version and the results it produces on my current
	scanner are simply fantastic.  I can't wait to see what you do
	in the upcoming years.<p> 

	Again, thank you for VueScan and all of those free updates.
	Needless to say that VueScan is my recommendation to any friend or
	acquaintance that uses a scanner.<p> 

	<hr> 

	Seiss Wagner - Architect:<p> 

	I purchased VueScan when I wanted more then what my Umax in the box
	scanner software provided.  When I purchased VueScan I assumed your
	interest in supporting the software would quickly wane and I would be
	looking for other developers products.<p> 

	I have now been using VueScan for nearly 10 years and I am happy to
	say I have never looked elsewhere.  I use VueScan for production
	drawing  work, and hand crafted presentation work imported to
	PhotoShop for editing.<p> 

	I have no hesitation in recommending your software to other design
	professional and have done so many times.  I always preface my
	recommendation with the comment that your product support is fastidious.<p> 

	THANK YOU for doing such a great job over the years.<p> 

	<hr> 

	Please feel free to
	<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/sup.html">e-mail us</a> 
	about how you use VueScan - we would love to tell
	other users about how you get the most from VueScan.<p>
