		<div class="row">
			<div class="span11 columns">
				<a name="q"> 
					<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(1);'>Does my scanner work with VueScan?</a><p>
					<div id="q1" class="well" style="display:none"> 
					If you want to find out whether a given scanner works with
					VueScan, the best way to find out is to consult the list of
					<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/vuescan.htm#supported">supported scanners</a> 
					and then
					<a href="vsm.html">download VueScan</a> and test it on your system.<p> 
					</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(2);'>Can I use VueScan on more than one computer?</a><p> 
				<div id="q2" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				You can use VueScan on up to four different computers that you personally
				use, with any combination of operating systems, with any number of
				scanners, both x32 and x64, with a single license.<p> 

				If more than one person (who isn't a family member) uses the computer,
				then you need a separate VueScan license for each computer.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(3);'>How can I get a new serial number and customer number?</a><p> 
				<div id="q3" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				If you've lost your serial number, or need a replacement
				serial number, you can
				<a href="https://www.hamrick.com/rep.html">get a new serial number online</a>.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(4);'>How can I change my registered e-mail address?</a><p> 
				<div id="q4" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				It's no problem leaving your e-mail address as it is.<p> 

				I don't use the e-mail addresses to send out e-mail,
				only to let people recover lost serial numbers.<p> 

				People get annoyed by anything that looks like spam, so
				I don't send out e-mails when I release new versions.<p> 

				Also, I don't have a tool to update this database.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(5);'>How can I get rid of the watermarks on my images?</a><p> 
				<div id="q5" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				The images you scanned before you bought VueScan have watermarks on them.
				You need to re-scan these images after you buy VueScan - you can't remove
				the watermarks from these images.<p> 

				If you bought the Standard Edition more than one year ago, you only qualified
				for free upgrades for one year after your purchase.  You'll get watermarks
				on images if you use the latest version of VueScan.  You can solve this by
				upgrading to the Professional Edition at
				<a href="https://www.hamrick.com/regu.html">https://www.hamrick.com/regu.html</a>.<p> 

				Alternatively, you can get a free upgrade to VueScan 8.5.41 at
				<a href="http://www.hamrick.com">http://www.hamrick.com</a>.<p> 

				To enter your Standard Edition or Professional Edition serial number
				into VueScan:<p> 

				<ol> 
				 <li>Make sure you're using an Administrator account
				 <li>Use the "Help | About" command ("VueScan | About" on Mac OS X)
				 <li>Enter the info from the receipt into the three boxes
				 <li>See if OK appears in all three boxes
				 <li>Press Close
				 <li>Do a preview
				 <li>Use the "Help | About" command ("VueScan | About" on Mac OS X)
				 <li>Verify that all three boxes contain the word "OK"
				</ol> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(6);'>How can I scan film with VueScan?</a><p> 
				<div id="q6" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				You need to be able to shine light through film to scan it.  If you
				have a scanner that only reflects light off the film (i.e. a normal
				flatbed scanner without a transparency adapter), then you can't scan
				film with it.<p> 

				If your flatbed scanner has a lamp in the scanner lid, make sure you've
				plugged the cable from the scanner lid into the back of the scanner.<p> 

				If you're using a Canon scanner on 64-bit Windows, make sure you're
				using the x64 version of VueScan 9.<p> 

				Check to see that the "Input | Mode" option has a transparency option.<p> 

				If you don't have a film scanner, you might look into getting a
				used Nikon or Minolta film scanner on ebay.com.  You can always
				sell it again on ebay when you're done with it.  You might even
				sell it for more than you paid for it - prices have been going up
				since Nikon stopped manufacturing film scanners.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(7);'>What kind of scanner should I buy?</a><p> 
				<div id="q7" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				It depends on what you plan on doing with the scanner.<p> 

				If you're scanning 35mm film, I recommend getting a used Nikon film scanner
				on ebay.com.  These are the best film scanners ever made.  They keep
				going up in value, so you can probably resell them on ebay.com for
				more than you paid.<p> 

				If you're mainly scanning documents, I recommend the Epson GT-S50, GT-S80,
				GT-1500 scanners.  They're quite fast, and work well with VueScan on
				Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  They also work well if you're scanning
				stacks of photos.  They very cleverly scan a stack of documents or
				photos into memory in the scanner, and this overlaps with the processing
				that VueScan does - the end result is amasingly fast scanning.<p> 

				If you need a small, light, portable scanner, I recommend the Canon LiDE scanners.<p> 

				If you're scanning film larger than 35mm, I recommend the Epson Perfection 4990
				on ebay.com or a new Epson Perfection V700.  They're very fast too.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(8);'>I really need to speak with you on the phone.  What's your number?</a><p> 
				<div id="q8" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				It isn't possible to speak with me (Ed Hamrick) on the phone.<p> 

				I'm easy to contact by e-mail, and I check e-mail every day.<p> 

				I have hundreds of thousands of customers, and the only way I can
				provide support to my customers is to do it by e-mail.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(9);'>I have a problem with VueScan. How do I solve it?</a><p> 
				<div id="q9" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				The vast majority of VueScan problems can be
				solved by running VueScan and choosing "File | Default options"
				from the menu and then doing a scan with minimal options changes.
				Be sure to try this before submitting a Problem Report, and be
				sure you're using the latest version of VueScan.<p> 

				If VueScan won't start, try disconnecting scanners and printers and
				seeing which one is causing the problem.<p> 

				If this doesn't solve the problem, we'd really
				appreciate it if you'd send a Problem Report.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(10);'>How do I submit a Problem Report?</a><p> 
				<div id="q10" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				You don't need to purchase VueScan to send a Problem Report
				(and if VueScan isn't working with your scanner, you
				shouldn't purchase it until it works).<p> 

				A Problem Report should contain:<p> 

				<ol> 
				 <li> The model of scanner you're using
				 <li> A brief description of the problem
				 <li> Things you've already tried to solve the problem
				 <li> <b>Make sure you attach vuescan.log to your e-mail</b>, as an uncompressed, unmodified attachment (not .zip, .rar, .rtf, .doc)
				 <li> Make sure you attach the exact procedure (recipe) used to
				      produce vuescan.log, and make sure this procedure is
				      comprehensive, detailed, and is the simplest
				      procedure needed to duplicate the problem
				 <li> If we've exchanged e-mails about this problem, please
				      be sure to attach them to the Problem Report.
				</ol> 

				The Problem Report should have a detailed, step by step
				description of the procedure (recipe) to duplicate the problem.
				A procedure is like a recipe - it's a detailed list of steps
				to make the problem happen.  It looks something like:<p> 

				<ol> 
				 <li>Turn off computer
				 <li>Turn off scanner
				 <li>Turn on scanner
				 <li>Turn on computer
				 <li>Check www.hamrick.com to make sure you have the latest version
				 <li>Run VueScan
				 <li>Use the "File | Default options" command
				 <li>Press the "Advanced" button
				 <li>Do this
				 <li>Do that
				 <li>Do this too
				 <li>Describe what happens when the problem happens
				 <li>Make a screen capture
				 <li>Exit VueScan
				</ol> 

				Then e-mail the procedure (recipe), the screen capture, the
				vuescan.log file after you use this procedure and
				a description of what happened when you used this procedure.<p> 

				Please note also that the heavy volume of e-mail makes it
				impractical to keep track of multiple e-mails about the same
				problem, and that each Problem Report needs to be completely
				contained in a single e-mail.  Each e-mailed Problem Report
				should only describe a single problem.<p> 

				Send your Problem Report to <a href="mailto:edhamrick@aol.com?subject=VueScan Problem Report">edhamrick@aol.com</a> (phone support is not available).
				<font color=red>E-mails without a vuescan.log file attachment are usually deleted with no response.
				Very detailed instructions for finding vuescan.log are on this page.</font><p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(11);'>How can I find the vuescan.log file?</a><p> 
				<div id="q11" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				<b>Mac OS X:</b> On Mac OS X, it's written to
				"/Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/vuescan.log".  You won't
				find this file with Spotlight, but click
				on the finder (the small blue box in the lower left corner
				of the Dock that looks like two people looking at each other).
				Then underneath "PLACES" on the left, you'll see "Desktop" and
				then a little house with your surname next to it. Click on this,
				and on the right you'll see a list of files and folders.  Click
				on "Library" and then click on "Preferences" inside the "Library"
				folder.  Inside the "Preferences" folder you'll see vuescan.log.
				Attach this file to your e-mail (not in a PDF file, not in a .doc
				file, not using the Console app, not zipped - just a plain file
				attachment).<p> 

				<b>Windows:</b> On Windows,
				it's normally written to "c:\vuescan\vuescan.log" or the default
				folder when VueScan starts.  The .log extension isn't displayed by
				the finder - it just says "vuescan - Text Document".<p> 

				<b>Linux:</b> On Linux, it's written to "~/.vuescan/vuescan.log".<p> 

				The vuescan.log file is <b>always</b> written to your hard drive,
				even if VueScan hangs when you run it.  One exception to this is if
				you've turned off the "Output | Log file" option.  If you've turned
				off "Output | Log file", delete vuescan.ini and run VueScan again.
				This will definitely create vuescan.log.<p> 
				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(12);'>Are there other payment options?</a><p> 
				<div id="q12" class="well" style="display:none"> 

				Short answer: No, there aren't any other options.<p> 

				Long answer:<p> 

				It's only possible to buy VueScan with a debit or credit card.
				I don't accept purchase orders, PayPal, checks, cash in the mail,
				bank transfers, orders from resellers or any other type of payment.<p> 

				Hamrick Software is just me, Ed Hamrick, and I do this for practical reasons.
				Other methods of taking orders take a lot of my time.  I decided that
				I can make far more money using this time to improve VueScan instead
				of using this time to handle orders.<p> 

				Handing bank transfers requires record-keeping, and I don't want to keep
				a list on paper of who I'm expecting transfers from, what their e-mail
				address is, checking the account each week, and then sending e-mails to
				people when I get their payments.  The same holds true for purchase orders,
				checks and PayPal - too much manual order processing.  I don't deal with
				resellers because I've found they waste a lot of my time asking
				for discounts, insisting I read pages of terms and conditions, messing
				up orders, wanting different information on invoices, etc.<p> 

				</div> 

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(13);'>I have a question. Can you help me?</a><p> 
				<div id="q13" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				I'm Ed Hamrick, the author of VueScan, and I
				personally read and respond to all support e-mail.<p> 

				<ul> 
				 <li>I get almost 100 e-mails every day, so please be brief.
				 <li>Your question should be less than 3 or 4 lines of text.
				 <li>If you've lost your serial number, click on "New Serial" at www.hamrick.com
				 <li>Short e-mails are usually answered in a day or so.  Long e-mails are usually not answered.

				<a href="#q" onclick='setvis(14);'>What is your Warranty and Return Policy?</a><p> 
				<div id="q14" class="well" style="display:none"> 
				If you're not satisfied, for any reason, just let us know within 30 days
				of purchase and we'll give you a full refund.<p> 

				To qualify for a refund, you need to test VueScan with your scanner before you buy it
				and you need to use VueScan for at least a week after you buy it.<p> 

				Just send an e-mail to edhamrick@aol.com and send the e-mail address you
				used when you purchased VueScan.  I'll do the refund within a day, and
				it should appear on your statement in the following few days.<p>
